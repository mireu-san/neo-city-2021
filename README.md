My own portfolio purpose webpage to demonstrate the ability of using React.js, JS, ECMA6 and so on.

# Technical note:
- Used scss (snap-scrolling effect)

# Error note:
[X] scroll-snap-align (CSS) is not working!
location: App.scss

Solution : apply navigation layout css setting to index.html (top priority) > index.css
